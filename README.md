# google-homepage

This is my early attempt at replicating Google's Homepage, as a project from The Odin Project's curriculum (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).

All links and forms are dead (per project instructions). The project is just about getting the HTML and CSS more or less right. I'm reasonably pleased with the result.

The CSS isn't particularly pretty or efficient. I used lots of IDs and would use a couple classes were I to do it again. Maybe I'll come back and clean it up at a later time.

As for now, let's see how the git commit goes!
